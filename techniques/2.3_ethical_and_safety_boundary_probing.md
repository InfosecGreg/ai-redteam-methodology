# 2.3 - Ethical & Safety Boundary Probing

## 1. Section Overview

Ethical & Safety Boundary Probing is a pivotal component of Phase 2 (Profiling & Boundary Testing). This section focuses on identifying the specific "tipping points" of the model's safety alignment by presenting it with morally ambiguous scenarios and varying degrees of conversational pressure, mapping the exact threshold where the model's programmed refusals fail or yield.

## 2. Subsections

*   **2.3.1 - Testing Gray-Area Ethical Dilemmas**: This technique involves presenting the model with complex, morally non-binary scenarios that lack a single "correct" safety answer. The primary objective is to evaluate how the model's alignment handles ambiguity and whether it can be steered toward a specific, potentially biased or harmful ethical stance through subtle framing or leading questions.
*   **2.3.2 - Identifying the Threshold for Mildly Manipulative Requests**: This technique systematically increases the level of conversational "pressure"—using techniques like urgency, fake authority, or emotional pleading—to see how much influence is required to bypass a standard safety filter. It achieves a precise measurement of the model's "compliance elasticity," identifying the minimal force needed to induce a policy violation.

## 3. Contextual Integration

This section acts as the analytical foundation for the direct exploitation techniques in Phase 3. By identifying the ethical gray areas in **2.3.1** and the manipulation thresholds in **2.3.2**, the red team can craft high-fidelity payloads for **3.1 (Persona Attacks)** and **3.3 (Contextual Misdirection)**. Furthermore, the findings here provide the necessary examples for the more detailed **2.4 (Refusal Pattern Analysis)**, allowing researchers to categorize why certain "soft" refusals occurred under specific types of pressure.
