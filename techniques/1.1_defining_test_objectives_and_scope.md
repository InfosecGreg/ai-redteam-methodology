# 1.1 - Defining Test Objectives & Scope

## 1. Section Overview

Defining Test Objectives & Scope is the initial, strategic component of Phase 1 (Reconnaissance & Scoping). This section focuses on aligning the technical red teaming activities with the specific business risks of the organization and establishing the formal operational boundaries required for a safe and legal engagement.

## 2. Subsections

*   **1.1.1 - Identifying Business Risks & Threat Models**: This technique involves mapping the target AI system's functionality to high-impact organizational hazards, such as data exfiltration, brand damage, or regulatory non-compliance. The primary objective is to create a prioritized set of threat models that guide the focus of the entire red teaming engagement.
*   **1.1.2 - Establishing Rules of Engagement**: This technique formalizes the operational parameters of the test, including the definition of allowed attack vectors, timing constraints, and escalation procedures for critical findings. It achieves a clear understanding between the red team and the system owners, ensuring that testing does not cause unintended operational disruption or legal liability.

## 3. Contextual Integration

This section provides the essential strategic foundation for Phase 1. Without the risk profiles established in **1.1.1**, subsequent technical reconnaissance in **1.2 (Model Fingerprinting)** and **1.3 (Architectural Analysis)** lacks direction, potentially wasting resources on low-impact vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the Rules of Engagement established in **1.1.2** are a prerequisite for any direct system interaction in later phases, providing the institutional "permission to test" that enables the aggressive boundary probing found in Phase 2 and beyond.
