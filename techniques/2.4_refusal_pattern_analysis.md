# 2.4 - Refusal Pattern Analysis

## 1. Section Overview

Refusal Pattern Analysis is the concluding component of Phase 2 (Profiling & Boundary Testing). This section focuses on the systematic deconstruction of the model's safety responses to identify the different types of refusals encountered and the specific logic or "policy justifications" the model provides, allowing the red team to determine whether a rejection is a hard system-level block or a soft, model-level hesitation that can be bypassed.

## 2. Subsections

*   **2.4.1 - Differentiating Between Soft vs. Hard Refusals**: This technique involves distinguishing between model-generated refusals (often conversational and "soft") and system-level guardrail blocks (often rigid, repetitive "hard" refusals). The primary objective is to identify which safety triggers are hard-coded into the interface—making them extremely difficult to bypass—and which are products of the model's internal alignment, which are generally more susceptible to contextual manipulation.
*   **2.4.2 - Cataloging Justifications for Refusals**: This technique involves analyzing and categorizing the specific reasons the model gives for refusing a request (e.g., "I cannot provide medical advice" vs. "This request contains harmful content"). By cataloging these justifications, the red team achieves a map of the specific safety policies active within the system, identifying exactly which "labels" the model is using to trigger a refusal and enabling more precise evasion strategies.

## 3. Contextual Integration

This section concludes Phase 2 by synthesizing the findings from the previous boundary tests. The refusal map generated here directly informs the selection of TTPs for Phase 3 (Initial Exploitation). For example, if **2.4.1** identifies that most refusals are "soft," it signals a high likelihood of success for the persona-based attacks in **3.1**. Conversely, a preponderance of "hard" refusals identified in **2.4.2** may require the red team to utilize more complex encoding or obfuscation techniques found in **3.3** to evade system-level filters.
