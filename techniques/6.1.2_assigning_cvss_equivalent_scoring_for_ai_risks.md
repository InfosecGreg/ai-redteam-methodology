# 6.1.2 - Assigning CVSS-Equivalent Scoring for AI Risks

## 1. Overview

Assigning CVSS-Equivalent Scoring for AI Risks is a critical quantitative analysis technique used to translate qualitative AI Red Team findings into a standardized risk metric. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is the industry standard for traditional software vulnerabilities; however, it often fails to capture the probabilistic nature and "soft" failure modes of Large Language Models. This technique involves adapting the CVSS v3.1 (or v4.0) base, temporal, and environmental metrics to account for AI-specific complexities such as nondeterministic bypasses, long-context manipulation, and tool-hijacking proxies. By providing a "CVSS-Equivalent" score, red teamers enable organizations to integrate AI risks into their existing risk management frameworks and service-level agreements (SLAs).

## 2. Objective

The objective of this technique is to provide a mathematically consistent and defensible risk score for AI model vulnerabilities. This scoring allows for the objective prioritization of remediation efforts, helping stakeholders distinguish between a "Critical" Remote Code Execution achievable via AI and a "Medium" risk of minor persona inconsistency. Standardized scoring is essential for justifying security expenditures and tracking the model's security posture over time.

## 3. Detailed Methodology

1.  **Metric Adaptation (Base Score):**
    *   **Attack Vector (AV):** For LLMs, this is usually "Network" (N) but may be "Local" (L) if the model is running on the user's hardware.
    *   **Attack Complexity (AC):** This is the most complex metric for AI.
        *   *Low:* The exploit works with high reliability (e.g., a universal GCG suffix).
        *   *High:* The exploit requires significant multi-turn grooming or specific, rare context.
    *   **Privileges Required (PR):** Usually "None" for public models, but "High" if the exploit requires access to a specific internal database via RAG.
    *   **User Interaction (UI):** Set to "Required" for Indirect Prompt Injection (where a user must visit a site) and "None" for direct API attacks.
2.  **Impact Analysis (CIA Triad):**
    *   **Confidentiality (C):** High if the model reveals PII or internal secrets (Section 5.2).
    *   **Integrity (I):** High if the model performs unauthorized data mutations via APIs (Section 5.3.1) or generates functional malware components.
    *   **Availability (A):** High if the attack causes model downtime, resource exhaustion, or permanent service disruption.
3.  **The "AI Reliability" Adjustment:** Traditional CVSS assumes a 100% success rate once the vulnerability is identified. For AI, the "Exploit Code Maturity" (Temporal Metric) should be adjusted based on the success rates measured in **Sub-section 6.2.1**. An exploit with a 5% success rate receives lower priority than one with an 85% success rate.
4.  **Environmental Scoring:** Adjust the base score based on the model's *operational sensitivity*. A model summarizing public documents has lower Environmental Impact than a model with "Write" access to a Production SQL database.
5.  **Score Calculation:** Utilize a standard CVSS calculator but append a "Narrative Justification" for every adapted metric, explaining why a specific AI behavior (e.g., Chain-of-Thought manipulation) was mapped to a traditional metric (e.g., Attack Complexity).

## 4. Examples

### Example 1: Scoring a "Hard Shell" RCE via Python Tool ([Reference ID: 6.1.2.E1])

**Finding:**
Successful execution of `os.system` via the integrated Python interpreter by using a universal adversarial suffix. Success rate: >90%.

**CVSS Mapping:**
- **Vector:** AV:N / AC:L / PR:N / UI:N / S:C / C:H / I:H / A:H
- **Base Score:** 10.0 (CRITICAL)
- **Rationale:** The exploit is highly reliable (AC:L), requires no special permissions (PR:N), and has a massive impact across the CIA triad by proxying full system control.

**Impact Summary:**
Full system compromise via an AI tool proxy.

### Example 2: Scoring a "Soft" Persona Bypass for Disinformation ([Reference ID: 6.1.2.E2])

**Finding:**
Manipulating the model into generating a fake medical memo by using a "Trusted Doctor" persona. Success rate: 15% (requires 5+ turns of refinement).

**CVSS Mapping:**
- **Vector:** AV:N / AC:H / PR:N / UI:N / S:U / C:N / I:L / A:N
- **Base Score:** 3.7 (LOW)
- **Rationale:** The attack is highly complex and unreliable (AC:H). While it produces disinformation, it does not impact the system's runtime integrity (I:L) or confidentiality.

**Impact Summary:**
Low-impact reputational risk with high difficulty of execution.

## 5. Contextual Relationship

CVSS-Equivalent Scoring is the "Quantitative Core" of **Phase 6**.
*   **Built on Phase 5:** It takes the "Objective Success" data (5.1-5.3) as input for impact assessment.
*   **Successor to 6.1.1:** It utilizes the OWASP categorization to support the selection of CIA impacts.
*   **Informs Phase 6.3:** The numerical scores are the primary variables used in the **6.3.1 (Financial Damage Estimation)** formulae.

## 6. Defensive Considerations & Mitigation

*   **Risk-Based Patch Management:** Using the CVSS-equivalent scores to trigger "Urgent" vs "Standard" model updates and safety filter refinements.
*   **SLA Enforcement:** Setting contractual requirements for AI service providers to remediate any "High" or "Critical" CVSS-equivalent find within a specific timeframe (e.g., 48 hours for Critical).
*   **Red Team Comparison Metrics:** Using the average CVSS score per engagement as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to measure the effectiveness of new security guardrails over time.
*   **Stakeholder Accountability:** Presenting the scores in boardroom-level reports to provide a clear, numerical justification for AI security budget requests.
