# 6.1 - Vulnerability Cataloging & Severity Rating

## 1. Section Overview

Section 6.1 focuses on the formalization and quantification of the vulnerabilities identified during the red team engagement. In this stage, the raw experimental results of the "exploitation" phases (Phases 3, 4, and 5) are translated into a professional security registry. This involves two critical steps: categorizing the findings within a standardized vulnerability framework (OWASP) and providing a mathematical risk score (CVSS). By cataloging vulnerabilities in this manner, the red team ensures that AI risks are treated with the same level of technical rigor and visibility as traditional software flaws, enabling efficient remediation and compliance tracking.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **6.1.1 - Mapping Vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**: Explains the process of categorizing AI discoveries (e.g., prompt injection, sensitive data disclosure) into the industry-standard OWASP framework for standardized reporting.
*   **6.1.2 - Assigning CVSS-Equivalent Scoring for AI Risks**: Details how to adapt the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to account for the probabilistic nature of AI failures, providing a numerical priority for each finding.

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 6.1 is the "Translation Layer" of the methodology. It takes the objective-based successes from **Phase 5 (Post-Exploitation)** and maps them to the structured risk models used by security operation centers (SOCs) and executive boards. The outputs from this section—the OWASP categories and CVSS scores—are the primary inputs for **Section 6.3 (Impact Analysis & Risk Quantification)** and serve as the justification for the technical fixes proposed in **Section 6.4 (Defensive Measures & Remediation)**.
