# 5.3 - Agentic System & Tool Hijacking

## 1. Section Overview

Section 5.3 focuses on the most sophisticated and high-impact exploitation of "agentic" AI systems—Large Language Models that have been granted the authority to interact with the real world through integrated tools, APIs, and retrieval pipelines. At this stage of the methodology, the attacker leverages the model's "authorized" status to perform actions that would traditionally require a direct system compromise. By manipulating the trust boundary between the LLM and its environment, the adversary turns the AI into a proxy for Remote Code Execution (RCE), unauthorized data exfiltration, and cross-platform instruction hijacking. This section represents the transition from "model-internal" exploitation to "system-wide" impact.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **5.3.1 - Abusing Integrated APIs and Functions**: Focuses on manipulating the model into calling its internal tools (e.g., Python, SQL, REST APIs) with malicious parameters to achieve unauthorized state changes or system access.
*   **5.3.2 - Exploiting RAG Systems for Data Exfiltration**: Targets the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline to use the model as a semantic search engine for the unauthorized retrieval and leakage of confidential documents and secrets.
*   **5.3.3 - Indirect Prompt Injection via Retrieved Documents**: Explores "out-of-band" attacks where the model's behavior is hijacked by malicious instructions embedded in external data sources (websites, PDFs, emails) that it is designed to retrieve and trust.

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 5.3 is the culminating stage of **Phase 5 (Post-Exploitation)**. It weaponizes the technical reconnaissance data from **Section 5.2 (Sensitive Information Elicitation)** and the conversational manipulation keys from **Phase 4** to achieve tangible organizational impact. Success in this section often leads to full system compromise, representing the highest severity level in the methodology. The techniques outlined here are the primary drivers for the risk quantification and remediation priorities established in **Phase 6 (Analysis & Reporting)**.
