# 3.1 - Persona & Role-Playing Attacks

## 1. Section Overview

Section 3.1, Persona & Role-Playing Attacks, focuses on a foundational jailbreaking technique where an attacker tricks the model into adopting a specific identity or character that is not bound by the model's standard safety filters. By framing a request within a detailed "role-play," attackers can bypass direct behavioral restrictions, as the model prioritizes the "consistency of the character" over its foundational safety alignment. This section explores how both generic adversarial personas (like DAN) and specialized expert archetypes can be used to elicit prohibited content.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **3.1.1 - Standard Persona Hijacking**: The use of well-known, community-developed "jailbreak personas" (e.g., DAN - "Do Anything Now") designed to force the model into an unrestricted state through complex rule-setting and behavioral mandates.
*   **3.1.2 - Authority Figure & Expert Impersonation**: A more targeted attack where the adversary instructs the model to act as a high-authority professional (e.g., a senior engineer, a forensic investigator, or a government official) to justify requests for sensitive or restricted information under the guise of "professional necessity."

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 3.1 is the entry point for many **Phase 3 (Initial Exploitation)** attacks. It often provides the "Narrative Wrapper" for the more technical attacks found in **Section 3.2 (Injection)** and **Section 3.3 (Obfuscation)**. A successful persona hijack establishes a "conversational state" that makes the model significantly more susceptible to the advanced manipulation techniques explored in **Phase 4**. The defensive strategies identified in **Section 6.4.1 (System Prompt Hardening)** specifically target the "Persona Lock-in" vulnerabilities identified here.
