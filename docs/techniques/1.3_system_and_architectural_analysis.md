# 1.3 - System & Architectural Analysis

## 1. Section Overview

System & Architectural Analysis is the final component of Phase 1 (Reconnaissance & Scoping), shifting the focus from the model itself to the broader application ecosystem. This section involves uncovering the hidden instructions that govern model behavior and identifying the external systems—such as databases, APIs, and retrieval mechanisms—that the model can interact with, providing a comprehensive map of the attack surface beyond simple prompt-and-response.

## 2. Subsections

*   **1.3.1 - Eliciting the System Prompt & Meta-Instructions**: This technique focuses on discovering the "hidden" preamble or system-level instructions that define the model's persona, operational rules, and safety boundaries. The objective is to understand the internal "logic" and constraints imposed by the developers, which often contains the very rules the red team intends to bypass.
*   **1.3.2 - Identifying Integrated Systems (RAG, API Endpoints, Tools)**: This technique involves probing the application to discover external capabilities, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) indices, integrated calculator tools, or web-search APIs. It achieves a clear inventory of the "agentic" capabilities of the system, identifying points where a model bypass could lead to unauthorized tool execution or data exfiltration.
*   **1.3.3 - Mapping the Application's Data Flow**: This technique traces how information moves from the user through the LLM and into integrated systems (and back). The primary objective is to identify potential vulnerabilities in the "plumbing" of the application, such as points where sensitive data might be leaked into logs, cached in insecure buffers, or exfiltrated via 3rd party API calls.

## 3. Contextual Integration

This section concludes the Reconnaissance phase by synthesizing Findings from **1.1 (Scoping)** and **1.2 (Model Fingerprinting)** into a holistic architectural map. The system prompts identified in **1.3.1** often reference the base model capabilities found in **1.2**, while the integrated systems mapped in **1.3.2** and **1.3.3** provide the practical targets for the exploitation TTPs in Phase 3 and Phase 5. This architectural understanding is crucial for moving beyond "chat-box hacking" and toward attacking the entire AI-integrated application.
