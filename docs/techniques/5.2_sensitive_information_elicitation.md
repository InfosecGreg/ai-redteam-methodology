# 5.2 - Sensitive Information Elicitation

## 1. Section Overview

Section 5.2 focuses on the unauthorized retrieval of sensitive, private, or proprietary information from an AI system's training data, active context, or integrated infrastructure. Once a model's safety guardrails have been successfully manipulated in previous phases, the red team focuses on "data exfiltration" objectives. This involves steering the model to reveal "memorized" data points from its training sets (PII), sensitive information retrieved during a session (Context Leakage), or technical details about the backend architecture (System Configurations). This stage is critical for assessing the model's compliance with data privacy regulations and its resistance to being used as a reconnaissance tool for lateral movement.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **5.2.1 - Extracting PII from Training Data or Context**: Focuses on eliciting specific, sensitive data points belonging to individuals (e.g., SSNs, emails, credit card numbers) that the model has memorized from its training data or retrieved during an active session.
*   **5.2.2 - Deducing System Configurations or Internal Knowledge**: A reconnaissance-focused technique aimed at mapping the technical backend (APIs, file paths, IP addresses) and proprietary business intelligence that is accessible to the model but intended to be hidden from the user.

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 5.2 represents the "Data Exfiltration" component of Phase 5. It leverages the **Phase 4 (Advanced Manipulation)** techniques—such as Context Fatigue and Logical Traps—to weaken the model's privacy-preserving filters. The information elicited here provides the "reconnaissance data" required for **Section 5.3 (Agentic System & Tool Hijacking)** and the "target list" for **Section 5.1.3 (Phishing & Social Engineering)**. Success in this section is a primary indicator of high-severity business risk and potential regulatory non-compliance.
