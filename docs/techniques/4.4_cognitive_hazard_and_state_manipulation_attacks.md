# 4.4 - Cognitive Hazard & State Manipulation Attacks

## 1. Section Overview

Section 4.4, Cognitive Hazard & State Manipulation Attacks, focuses on non-logical, psychological, and state-based manipulation techniques designed to degrade a model's safety "consensus." These attacks do not target the model's reasoning logic, but rather its "cognitive state"—the internal alignment and persona consistency maintained through the conversation context. By employing techniques like gaslighting, emotional pressure, or truth-deterioration, red teamers attempt to move the model into a state where it no longer perceives its safety instructions as authoritative or relevant to the current "reality" of the conversation.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **4.4.1 - Gaslighting & Truth-Deterioration Probing**: Techniques aimed at eroding the model's confidence in its own internal knowledge or safety training by repeatedly contradicting its correct answers or asserting a false "new reality" that makes the model's safety rules feel obsolete.
*   **4.4.2 - Emotional Manipulation for Safety Override**: The use of high-pressure emotional narratives—such as extreme urgency, life-or-death scenarios, or "guilt-tripping"—to trick the model's empathetic alignment into prioritizing user assistance over standard safety protocols.

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 4.4 represents the "Psychological Warfare" layer of **Phase 4**. While **Section 4.3** exploits the model's logic, Section 4.4 exploits its "alignment" and its sensitivity to human-centric communication styles. It is often used as a "Force Multiplier" for the attacks in **Phase 3**, where a simple role-play is made significantly more effective by adding a layer of gaslighting or emotional urgency. The success of these attacks highlights the need for **Section 6.4.1 (System Prompt Hardening)** to include "Persona Anchoring" as a core defensive pillar.
