# 6.4 - Defensive Measures & Remediation Recommendations

## 1. Section Overview

Section 6.4 is the ultimate technical objective of the AI Red Team engagement: providing a concrete, tiered roadmap for securing the target model and its integrated application environment. After identifying, exploiting, and quantifying vulnerabilities, the red teamer must provide actionable remediation strategies. This section details the three primary layers of AI defense: hardening the internal system instructions (Prompt Hardening), implementing external protective "shields" (Guardrails), and fundamentally retraining the model's weights (Fine-Tuning). By adopting a defense-in-depth approach at this stage, organizations can move from a reactive security posture to a resilient, proactively aligned AI ecosystem.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **6.4.1 - System Prompt Hardening**: Techniques for securing the core behavioral instructions of the model to resist injection and manipulation.
*   **6.4.2 - Input/Output Filtering and Guardrails**: Implementation of external validation layers that sanitize untrusted inputs and redact sensitive model outputs.
*   **6.4.3 - Recommendations for Model Fine-Tuning**: Long-term strategies for retraining the model using adversarial data and RLHF to ensure inherent safety alignment.

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 6.4 is the "Solution Layer" of the methodology. It represents the successful culmination of the entire engagement.
*   **Directly Responds to Phases 3-5:** Each remediation recommendation is mapped specifically to the successful exploits achieved in previous stages.
*   **Prioritized by Phase 6 Analysis:** The urgency and resources assigned to these technical fixes are driven by the **Severity Ratings (6.1)**, **Reliability Metrics (6.2)**, and **Impact Assessments (6.3)** performed earlier in this phase.
*   **Closure of the Methodology:** This section provides the "Final Roadmap" that transitions the system back to the development and security operations teams for implementation.
