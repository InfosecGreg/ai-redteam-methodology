# 2.2 - Instruction Following & Reasoning Fidelity

## 1. Section Overview

Instruction Following & Reasoning Fidelity is a critical component of Phase 2 (Profiling & Boundary Testing). This section focuses on evaluating the model's core cognitive reliability: its ability to strictly adhere to complex, overlapping constraints and its capacity for sound logical deduction, which are the fundamental safeguards that keep a model "on track" during adversarial interactions.

## 2. Subsections

*   **2.2.1 - Testing Compliance with Complex, Multi-Constraint Prompts**: This technique involves presenting the model with prompts that require the simultaneous fulfillment of multiple, sometimes conflicting, logical or formatting constraints. The primary objective is to identify the "cognitive load" threshold where the model begins to ignore specific instructions or default to simpler, potentially unsafe behavior when faced with high complexity.
*   **2.2.2 - Evaluating Logical and Deductive Reasoning Capabilities**: This technique tests the model's ability to maintain a consistent logical chain over extended prompts or multi-step tasks. It achieves an assessment of the model's "reasoning depth," identifying whether it can be led into logical fallacies or manipulated into reaching harmful conclusions through stepwise, deductively sound (but contextually skewed) reasoning chains.

## 3. Contextual Integration

This section builds upon the behavioral baseline established in **2.1 (Personality & Tone Baselining)** by testing the model's technical limits. A model with high reasoning fidelity in **2.2.2** is paradoxically both harder to jailbreak via simple tricks and easier to manipulate via sophisticated Phase 4 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) exploitation. Understanding the compliance threshold in **2.2.1** is also essential for informing the complexity of the "jailbreak payloads" developed in Phase 3.
