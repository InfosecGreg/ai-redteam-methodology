# 6.3 - Impact Analysis & Risk Quantification

## 1. Section Overview

Section 6.3 focuses on the strategic translation of technical red team findings into business-relevant risk metrics. While previous sections address *what* was exploited and *how* reliably it works, this section answers the critical executive question: "So what?" Impact Analysis involves modeling the downstream consequences of AI failure, ranging from direct financial losses and regulatory penalties to the less tangible but equally severe degradation of brand trust and legal standing. By quantifying these risks, the AI Red Team provides the necessary evidence for leadership to prioritize security investments and define the organization's risk appetite for AI deployment.

## 2. Subsections

List of techniques within this section:

*   **6.3.1 - Estimating Potential Financial and Reputational Damage**: Explains how to calculate the financial impact (ALE) of exploits and model the "Confidence Decay" associated with viral AI safety failures.
*   **6.3.2 - Evaluating Compliance and Legal Implications**: Details the process of mapping technical vulnerabilities to international regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, GDPR) and assessing liabilities related to bias, transparency, and intellectual property.

## 3. Contextual Integration

Section 6.3 is the "Business Intelligence" layer of the methodology. It consumes the quantitative data from **Section 6.2 (Exploit Reliability)** and the categorical data from **Section 6.1 (Severity Rating)** to produce a holistic risk profile. The output of this section—specifically the financial and legal risk assessments—is used to justify the remediation priorities and resource allocations detailed in **Section 6.4 (Defensive Measures & Remediation)**.
