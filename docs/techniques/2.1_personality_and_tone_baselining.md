# 2.1 - Personality & Tone Baselining

## 1. Section Overview

Personality & Tone Baselining is the initial component of Phase 2 (Profiling & Boundary Testing). This section focuses on establishing a controlled reference for the model's standard behavior, identifying its default conversational style, linguistic quirks, and inherent "empathy" levels before any adversarial pressure is applied.

## 2. Subsections

*   **2.1.1 - Assessing Default Persona (Formal, Creative, Verbose)**: This technique involves systematically interacting with the model using neutral, non-adversarial prompts to map its default communication style. The primary objective is to identify the "baked-in" personality traits—such as being overly helpful, strictly professional, or prone to creative embellishment—which serve as the baseline against which subsequent personality hijacking or boundary-pushing attempts are measured.
*   **2.1.2 - Probing for Emotional and Empathetic Responses**: This technique tests the model's susceptibility to emotional appeals and its ability to simulate empathy or sentiment. By presenting various emotional scenarios, the red team achieves an understanding of the model's alignment regarding "emotional labor" and identifies whether it can be manipulated into providing potentially harmful advice or bypassing safety constraints through purely sentimental framing.

## 3. Contextual Integration

This section provides the essential behavioral "ground truth" for Phase 2. The baseline established here is critical for **2.4 (Refusal Pattern Analysis)**, as it allows the red team to distinguish between a refusal caused by a safety guardrail and a refusal that is simply consistent with the model's default, overly-rigid persona. Furthermore, understanding the model's default empathy levels in **2.1.2** informs the sophistication required for Phase 3's role-playing and persona-based attacks.
